# SOCIAL-PROJECT-ECOTURISM
Innovative project creating short films with the support of AI technology, promoting sustainable ecotourism in the United States, starting in Colorado. As part of the "Your Green Footprint" initiative, tourists will participate in ecological restoration by planting native species supervised by the relevant authorities, receiving digital certificates with estimated CO₂ capture impact.

Key Components:
1.	10 short films in iconic Colorado locations (e.g., Rocky Mountains, Mesa Verde), with narratives that merge adventure, ancestral culture, and conservation
2.	Sustainable Monetization ("EcoReels"): 8 strategic axes include government partnerships, streaming, green sponsorships, film festivals, and tourism experiences. Interactive and gamified applications
3.	Triple Impact:
    *	Environmental: Ecosystem restoration and CO₂ capture.
    *	Social: Culture-nature connection and local employment.
    *	Economic: Development of tourism ventures and B2B models.

Technology:
Automated editing, georeferencing, AI-powered application for authorized personalized routes, and ecological impact monitoring.

Scope:
Scalable project with potential for replication in other states, aligned with sustainability and creative economy goals.

Implementation:
First phase: Creation of initial alliances (estimated time: 0-6 months)
Second phase: Expansion (estimated time: 6-18 months)
Third phase: Consolidation (estimated time: 18+ months)
